PROJECT ON UTILITY SECTOR

Project Scope:
- Gain more familiarity by practicing data-driven analysis using publicly-available federal regulatory data (FERC Form 1 via PUDL, EIA-861) on three of California's major electric utilities (PG&E, SCE, SDG&E) in a practice-level Rate Case Analysis.

Scope Boundaries:
    - OM Expense Analysis via FERC category
    - Total Utility rate base and revenue requirement 
    - Residential bill impact using actual revenue shares
    - Multi-year trend and peer comparison
    - OUR PROJECT:(BASELINE CHECK) Tests only if historical trends support assumptions
        - Establish baseline -- (ex: Historical spend and CAGR %)
        - Identify red flags -- (ex: Year/Utility Outlier Detection)
        - Quantifying expected ranges
        - Informing where to focus -- (Ex: Peer analysis may show $/mile difference)
        - Finding: Request is x% above trend--- warrants detailed review
        - Proceed to dig into claims, evidence, contracts (confidential) 
            -> recommendation -> adoption
    
    - ACTUAL?: Staff verifies if utility's specific claims are reasonable (the math add-up in terms of evidence, contracts, etc to support decision)

Deliverables:
    - Data pipeline (Python ETL extract/clean/joining FERC/EIA data)
    - Analysis Module (Stat analysis -- Regression, trend, benchmark, outliers)
    - Rev. Req. Model (Calc RR w/ Gap Analysis and Test-year projection)
    - Bill Impact Calc (Resident. bill projection (add sensitivity analysis scenarios)
    - Visualization (Need to finish) (Trend charts, peer comparison, bill impact)
    - Exec. Summary (Conclusive findings and staff-style recommendation)

Data Sources: [2018 - 2023]
    - FERC Form 1 via PUDL -- OM Expenses, Rate Base, Operating Revenue by FERC account
    - EIA-861 -- Retail sales, Customer counts, revenue by customer class 

Rate Case Calculations
    1. Revenue Requirement -- The Core Number
     - Revenue Req = O&M + Depreciation + Taxes + Return on Rate Base
     - OM : D2D operating costs (labor fuel maintenance customer service)
     - Depreciation: Annual wear-and-tear on capital assets (poles, wires, powerplant)
     - Return on Rate Base: Profit margin on invested capital
     -T axes: Federal + state income taxes

    2. Bill Impact -- What customers care about
     - Calc: 1. Take revenue requirement change
          2. Allocate to customer classes
          3. Divide by total kWh sales to get average rate ($/kWh)
          4. Multiply by avg monthly usage (kWh) to get monthly bill
          5. Compare current vs proposed
        ex: Current res. bill (125/month), Proposed res. bill (134/month), 
            change +9/month(+7.2%), Annual impact (+108/year)

    3.Test Year Forecasting
     - Rate cases don't use current costs- they use projected costs for a future year
     - Base year: 2023 recorded costs (audited, known)
     - Test year: 2025 projected costs(escalated by inflation,load growth,known change)
    -> forecast_test_year_rr: func -> applies escalation factors to project a request

    PROJECT ASSUMPTIONS:
    - depreciation rate 3.5% (actual requires FERC Schedule 336)(~30yr avg asset life)
    - WACC (industry standard ~7.5%)
    - Tax rate of ~27% (combined fed 21 + state 6 as a standard assuption)
    - Avg residential use: 500 kWh/month
    - O&M Escalation: 3% (Inflation Proxy + slight labor cost growth)
        - Actual: specific escalation proposal with contracts
    - Rate base growth: 4% (Reflects ongoing Capital Investment trend)
        - Actual: Utility proposes specific projects with studies

Analysis
    - Trend Analysis -- requested increase consistent with historical patterns?
    - Cost Driver Regression -- cost growth explained by legitimate factors?
    - Peer Benchmarking -- utility efficient compared to peers?
    - Outlier Detection -- anomalous years that shouldn't set the baseline?
    - Revenue Gap --  utility currently over- or under-collecting?
    - Bill Impact -- ustomers? Is it affordable?
